Federal Open Source Repositories
================================

Live version available at: 
-------------------------

http://federal-repositories.herokuapp.com/  (you'll have to do a one-time authentication against your github account)

_Note that the original version at http://gsa.github.com/federal-open-source-repos/ is still live but now hits the API rate limits of GitHub for unathenticated users.  This is a good problem! It's because there's such growth in government GitHub usage._  

**Also note sister projects** at www.govcode.org and http://ada.mbecker.cc/USAxGITHUB.
